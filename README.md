So you have this friend who is a new student this year. She pretended to be friends with you, but she gave you these candy bar things that made you gain weight, turned your best friends against you, and made out with your boyfriend and convinced him to break up with you. Oh, and she gave you foot cream instead of face cream.

<br>

What if The Plastics had an app for their Burn Book, instead of a physical book? <br> What if Regina had made that app public, instead of throwing photocopies of pages all over the school? <br> What if girls from the school could upload other girl's pictures, and write comments? <br> That would be full tilt jungle madness.
